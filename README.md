# README

# About:

Chrome extension and website that detects SQL attacks and Generates random passwords

# Requirements and eligibility:

The extension is only available on the Chrome web store, website can be anywhere.
Access for downloading this extension from Github is only restricted to select browsers with extension compatibility

# Instructions for configuration (extension):

DOWNLOAD: Click "Code" above the repository
Then Click "Download ZIP" 

Then,

On your browser that supports the usage of extensions, <-

Navigate to the "Manage Extensions" setting of your browser <- 

On Chrome specifically: Select 3 dots in the upper right corner > Extensions > Manage Extensions >
[upper right corner] Enable developer mode > Load unpacked > Click the whole folder containing extension materials

Other browsers should have similar directions to Chrome's directions ^

# Instructions for configuration (Website):

Simply click the link: [https://calculatorsnet.github.io/2025-SQL-Hackathon/](url)

# Usage:

In the website and the extension, you can paste your code into the extension's input box.
Then select the programming language the code is in
wait for it to detect patterns to check for a SQL injection attack.

The second feature, random password generator, will work if you switch to that feature.
To use the feature, select how long the password should be, (between 4 and 64 characters) 
and then click "Generate" to receieve your randomly generated password.

# Crack the Code 2025: Write Up
	
   Our Tool, SQL Shield is an innovative app that scans your code for SQL injection attacks. Our inspiration for making this app is how often our websites have had SQL injection attacks. We aim to provide a safe, protective, and practical app that can prevent these SQL injection attacks. This extension also addresses password security, generating passwords for users based on their customization of the extension. As hackers have evolved, so have their methods of cracking passwords. Our research has aimed to combat the effectiveness of traditional brute-force password crackers. Our depth of research has looked into many articles to see what exactly is a good way to combat password crackers. After coming up with an idea, we started implementation.
	
 Some vulnerabilities we aim to solve are the large SQL injection attacks that happen worldwide. Our random password generation feature also solves the threat of a password being guessed. This random generation makes it so tough for brute password breakers to find your password. The functionality of the feature aims to provide safe, secure, and fool-proof passwords that can’t be cracked due to their complexity. Our SQL software functions by activating the extension through the built-in extension on your browser.
We’ve spent countless hours developing this project; so we didn’t use any libraries, frameworks, or any outside source code. We took this approach as we believe that writing this code ourselves will give us a far better understanding of the script and help us understand various programs better in the future. By learning to write code ourselves, we are preparing a future related to computer science and programming, something that is expected to boom in the next decades.
	
 SQL injection attacks can have massive impacts on users, companies, and websites alike. This is because the consequences may include data breaches, access to sensitive information, and even a potential system takeover. This is why we strive to provide a safe way to see if code is prone to an SQL injection attack, with SQL Shield.
	
 Continuing to address user security, our next feature of making automatic safe passwords makes it so that the average person can defend the websites and applications they log in with. This makes a huge impact on user security as password complexity is something that is so well made, that hacker brute force cracking tools have not been able to catch up to this yet, making the complex generations successful in generating passwords. The system will also make sure that you have a password at least eight letters long so it isn't too simple and short for hackers to guess.
	
 Our final feature, though hypothetical, is the use of Orkes Conductor. Though we weren’t able to get it to work properly, we planned on adding a third feature to the extension, where users can discreetly enter their passwords and receive a “score” on how strong their password is, on a scale of 1-10. With this checker as well as the sister password generator, we look to provide users with more secure defenses in their browsing, especially when they log on, and it’s a quick way to make sure that their passwords to private information are not prone to compromise.
	
 This extension will have a lasting effect on the current industry if developed well. As of now, our foundation is solid. If we happen to develop our idea, the effects will last for quite a while. These impacts are on various industries, such as the cybersecurity and programming industries. This is due to the many different styles we used within our project along with the innovative and extremely functional design of the project as well. Our styles such as incorporating support for multiple programming languages give the program the edge of evolution compared to the average program. It is also different from common cybersecurity practices because it utilizes functionality through an extension format, which isn’t common and will be far superior and conventional compared to common cybersecurity practices.
	
 Some limitations this project may possess are how the extension is only limited to the extension. For one, our website is only displaying the tool, and the tool cannot actually be used on the website. There is no way to use it as an outside app within your operating system to use independently. The app may be extremely useful, but it is only limited to SQL injection attacks and random password generators. However, for some ground-breaking improvements, we plan to import a lot more features into the app to allow the app to be far more useful in identifying threats. This is because hackers and their infiltration methods are evolving rapidly, leaving the job to cybersecurity analysts and others to protect the world’s computers and critical infrastructure. We also tried to implement a password strength checker using Orkes Conductor, and it did not work. If it did, we would be able to show users of their potentially compromised passwords and help them generate new tools with the generation tools.
  
  On another note, giving the extension access to become an independent piece of software will allow us to incorporate more features such as virus scanning, ad blocking, and phishing prevention. When we do this, the product may allow turning this small extension into a large, ground-breaking application. Seeing these features in the common computing world such as an IT administrator utilizing this extension to check for SQL injections in employee code can certainly help users and companies alike speed up manual tasks and invest more time focusing on more special work that can help improve modern technology.
  
  We can assure you that this development process was not easy. Our research started with simply learning about SQL injections. This process took hours of concentrated research, input, and focused development. We referred to articles on SQL, such as example prompts on W3Schools as well.  For many hours, starting at 9:00 AM on a Saturday morning, our team has constantly been researching, starting with brainstorming for good ideas, and how to implement them. Finally, we settled on a good idea, a SQL injection finder. 
	
 As we were researching and developing, we ran into many hindrances along the path to success. There were times when we felt like giving up and passing the time to play games. And we did. Our motivation and perseverance still allowed us to stay strong and complete the project. Through this process, we researched, coded, and researched till we reached the desired output. More importantly, we learned to persevere in the face of challenges and we learned coding skills that are guaranteed to support us for ages to come.
